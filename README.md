Wordpress Admin Chartbeat Widget
================================

This is just a little admin widget for Wordpress to show your current top pages using the Chartbeat API.

The widget will load on the bottom left of your admin dashboard. Re-order it for better prominence for your writers to see when they log in to Wordpress.

This is a great way to see what's trending on your site without having to give all your writers Chartbeat access/accounts, and without having a public-facing display of what's hot on your site.
